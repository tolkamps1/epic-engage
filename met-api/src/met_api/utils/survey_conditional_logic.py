"""Extract conditional-visibility links between survey questions from form_json.

A follow-up free-text question (simpletextarea/simpletextfield) is often only shown to a
respondent when they picked a specific answer on an earlier question - either a specific row of
a Likert (simplesurvey) or Ranking (simpleranking) matrix, or a specific option of a plain
Radio (simpleradios) / Dropdown (simpleselect) question. That relationship is never persisted
on its own - it only exists inside the follow-up component's form.io "conditional" config - so
it has to be recovered by parsing each component's conditional settings.

Checkbox (simplecheckboxes) triggers work like a matrix rather than like radio/select: the
submitted value is an object of booleans keyed by option (`{optionKey: bool}`), so a follow-up
hangs off one *option* of the checkbox the way another hangs off one row of a Likert. The option
is therefore recorded as the link's row, and the value only ever says the box was ticked.

The Visual Builder (met-formio's ConditionBuilder, which owns ``conditional.json``) roots every
field reference at ``data.`` - form.io evaluates the tree as ``jsonLogic.apply(json, {data, row,
form, _})``, so a bare name would not resolve. The prefix is stripped here before a var path is
read as a component key, and paths written before it was introduced are still accepted.

Form.io resolves a component's visibility from whichever of these is populated, in this
precedence order: the Advanced JavaScript conditional (``customConditional``) or the Advanced
Conditional / JSON Logic builder (``conditional.json``) - whichever has content wins over the
simple conditional (``conditional.show``/``when``/``eq``). In practice only one of
customConditional/conditional.json is ever populated for a given component, but both still take
priority over the simple conditional when present, so this module only reads
``conditional.when``/``eq`` for a component that has neither advanced field set.
